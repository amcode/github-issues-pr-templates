#Github Issues and Pull Request templates

Github supports templates that can be used for issues and pull requests (PR). This allows your project to have a consistent look and feel when you raise an issue or PR.

##How to create Issue and PR templates

In the root of your repo simply add a directory called `.github`. Inside this directory create two files `issue_template.md` and `pull_request_template.md`.

Add Markdown text to the template to  build up the desired layout for your templates.

##Examples

Sample Issue template:
https://github.com/amcode/github-issues-pr-templates/issues/new

Sample PR template:
https://github.com/amcode/github-issues-pr-templates/compare
